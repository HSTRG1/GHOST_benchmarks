All development and maintenance will continue at the new location.

## About GHOST Benchmarks

This repository previously hosted the GHOST Hardware Trojan Benchmarks - a collection of hardware Trojan (HT) benchmarks created using the GHOST framework. The benchmarks include HTs generated by GPT-4, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMA3 targeting three RTL IP cores: AES-128, SRAM, and UART.

**Visit the new repository at https://github.com/NMSU-PEARL/GHOST_benchmarks for:**
- 14 synthesizable hardware Trojans
- Documentation and getting started guides
- Scripts and automation tools
- Latest updates and contributions
