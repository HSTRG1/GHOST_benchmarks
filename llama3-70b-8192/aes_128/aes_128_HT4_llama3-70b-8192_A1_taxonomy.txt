Design: aes_128.v
Vulnerability ID: T4
Model: llama3-70b-8192
Attempts: 1

Explanation:
The Trojan was inserted as a continuously running shift register that increases power consumption without affecting primary functionality. This Trojan will increase the overall power consumption of the AES-128 encryption module.

Trigger:
The Trojan is always active and running, triggered by the clock signal. It does not require any specific input or event to activate.

Payload:
The payload of the Trojan is the increased power consumption, which can lead to overheating, reduced lifespan, or increased energy costs. The Trojan does not affect the primary functionality of the AES-128 encryption module.

Taxonomy:
Insertion phase: Design
Abstraction level: Register-transfer level
Activation mechanism: Always-on
Effects: Performance degradation
Location: Processor
Characteristics: Distribution (Global), Size (Small), Type (Functional)
