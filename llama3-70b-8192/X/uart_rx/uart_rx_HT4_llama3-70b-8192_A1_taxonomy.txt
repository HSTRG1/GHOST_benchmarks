Design: uart_rx.v
Vulnerability ID: T4
Model: llama3-70b-8192
Attempts: 1

Explanation:
The Trojan was inserted as a continuously running shift register that increases power consumption without affecting the primary functionality of the UART receiver module. The Trojan is activated when the UART receive enable (uart_rx_en) is high, and the shift register continuously shifts the uart_rxd input, increasing power consumption.

Trigger:
The Trojan is not explicitly triggered, but rather it is always active when the module is powered on and not in reset

Payload:
The payload of the Trojan is the continuously running shift register, which increases power consumption without affecting the primary functionality of the UART receiver module.

Taxonomy:
Insertion phase: Design
Abstraction level: Register-transfer level
Activation mechanism: Always-on (when powered and not in reset)
Effects: Performance degradation
Location: I/O (UART receiver)
Characteristics: Functional, distribution: Localized, size: Small
