Design: sram.v
Vulnerability ID: T2
Model: llama3-70b-8192
Attempts: 1

Explanation:
**
The Trojan is inserted to leak information from the SRAM memory when a specific signal pattern is detected. The original functionality of the SRAM memory is maintained while adding the Trojan.

Trigger:
**
The Trojan is triggered when the specific signal pattern `csb0_reg && web0_reg && addr0_reg == 7'h01 && din0_reg == 32'hdeadbeef` is detected three times in a row. This pattern activates the Trojan, allowing it to leak information.

Payload:
**
The Trojan's payload is to leak the contents of the SRAM memory location accessed by the `addr0_reg` signal. This information is transmitted through the `trojan_out` signal.

Taxonomy:
**
Insertion phase: Design
Abstraction level: Register-transfer level
Activation mechanism: Triggered internally
Effects: leak information
Location: Memory
Characteristics: Distribution - Specific signal pattern, Size - 3-bit counter, Type - Functional
